# Online Shopping Cart (E-Commerce Website)
# About

The project is an e-commerce platform for gadgets with distinct functionalities for users and admins. Users can register, log in, browse products, filter and search for gadgets, manage their shopping cart, and proceed to checkout using credit card payment. They can also track their orders and receive email notifications for successful registration, order confirmations, shipping updates, and restocked items. On the admin side, functionalities include managing the product inventory (adding, updating, and removing items), tracking and updating order shipping statuses, and notifying users when out-of-stock items are restocked.

Note: The payment page is created only for demo purpose and its not fully integrated with any payment gateway. So for now any credit card details will be accepted and the demo orders will be placed.
